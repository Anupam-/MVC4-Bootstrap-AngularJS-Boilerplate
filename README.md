HTML5 / MVC4 / Bootstrap / AngularJS Boilerplate
====================================

This is simply a default template I have set up to speed up future projects.

The initial template was created using ![Initializr](http://www.initializr.com) and then converted to be MVC 4 / Bootstrap friendly.

I then created the folder structure for AngularJS and initialized it in main.js with a dummy controller called 'AppController', which just has a version number attached to it.

Feel free to fork and add as you wish!
